## 🎯 Purpose

**aws-startup-terraform-modules** empowers startups to:

- **Deploy Infrastructure in Minutes**: Pre-built, tested modules eliminate weeks of configuration work
- **Follow AWS Best Practices**: Each module implements security, reliability, and cost optimization patterns
- **Scale Progressively**: Start with basic modules, add advanced features as you grow
- **Maintain Compliance**: Built-in encryption, logging, and audit trails meet SOC2/ISO27001 requirements
- **Combine Categories**: Build complete environments by composing modules across categories

### Example Startup Architectures

**SaaS Web Application:**
```
networking/vpc-networking → networking/alb-loadbalancer → compute/ecs-fargate-service
→ storage-databases/rds-postgres-database → networking-cdn/cloudfront-cdn
→ security-iam/secrets-manager → monitoring-ops/cloudwatch-monitoring-alarms
```

**Serverless API Platform:**
```
compute/lambda-api-gateway → storage-databases/dynamodb-nosql-table
→ security-iam/iam-roles-policies → devops-automation/codepipeline-ci-cd
→ monitoring-ops/budget-cost-alerts
```

**AI-Powered Application:**
```
networking/vpc-networking → compute/eks-kubernetes-cluster
→ ai-modern-tools/bedrock-llm-endpoint → storage-databases/elasticache-redis
→ ai-modern-tools/opensearch-logging
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.5.0
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- An AWS account with necessary permissions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-startup-terraform-modules.git
cd aws-startup-terraform-modules
```

2. **Navigate to a module:**
```bash
cd networking/vpc-networking
```

3. **Review and customize variables:**
```bash
cp examples/example.tf main.tf
# Edit main.tf with your specific values
```

4. **Deploy:**
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Using Modules from Terraform Registry

Once published, reference modules directly:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "your-org/vpc-networking/aws"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  environment         = "production"
  vpc_cidr            = "10.0.0.0/16"
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  
  tags = {
    Project = "my-startup"
    Team    = "platform"
  }
}
```
